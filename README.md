# PAVO

A Python Photo and Video batch renaming and organising tool. Pavo is also Spanish for Turkey!

# Rationale
I couldn't find a simple tool to quickly rename and organise photo and video files taken on my GoPro and other cameras.
This tool allows the user to select a directory via a GUI and rename files, adding date and time taken. I intend to add a few other features but it's mainly designed for my own use.

# Useage

After starting the Script, browse to the folder which contains the files you wish to rename via the **'Browse'** button.

**Scan files** - reveals the folder contents with existing file names:

The text box **'Custom Name'** allows the user to create a meaningful name for the files e.g. 'USholidayDay1'.
The tool will add date taken and time taken to each file name.

Use the **'Preview Changes'** button to see how the new naming structure will look.

The final step is to rename the files. A success window will pop up once complete.
