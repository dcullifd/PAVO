# PAVO
A Python Photo and Video batch renaming and organising tool

# Rationale
I couldn't find a simple tool to quickly rename and organise photo and video files taken on my GoPro and other cameras.
This tool allows the user to select a directory via a GUI and rename files, adding date and time taken.

# Useage

After starting the Script, browse to the folder which contains the files you wish to rename via the 'Browse' button

Scan files - reveals the folder contents with existing file names:

The text box 'Custom Name' allows the user to create a meaningful name for the files e.g. 'USholidayDay1'.
The tool will add date taken and time taken to each file name.

'Preview Changes' to see how the new naming structure will look.

The final step is to rename the files, A success window will pop up once complete.
